# Apollo Automation

Place your `API_KEY` in `main.py` and replace `company_url` with the URL of the company you're sourcing. Then, running `main.py` will populate your already created Sequence with emails from that company for relevant roles.


TODOs (feel free to contribute):
- API key as environment variable.
- Company URL as command line argument.
- Multiple company URLs through some sort of spreadsheet.
